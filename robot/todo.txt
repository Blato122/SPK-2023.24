actually understand that

toy example bidirectional radio communication -> actual radio communication (send distance, get action FORWARD/BACKWARD/TURN180DEG) -> implement turning (180 degrees) - prob will need to check the time of the turn to make it 180 deg!
-> implement choosing the best action based on the distance
